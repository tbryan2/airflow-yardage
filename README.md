## Motivation
Data scientists spend a majority of their time developing models. At the end of this process, when they have a model they're happy with, they need a way to generate predictions on live, real world data. All of the effort up until this point has been spent on creating the model without any thought put into model deployment. The goal of this project is to create a __functional model__; in other words, to create a model where:

1) Generating predictions is both easy and automated, and
2) There can be continuous improvement of the model

By starting with the finished product in mind it validates all the effort spent on model development.
